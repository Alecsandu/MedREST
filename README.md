## Idea
This API was designed with the scope of provining the people which work in hospitals with a nice tool to manage their data.

## Features
The MedREST API has the following features:
- <b>CRUD</b> operations for different types of data(for example departments and patients data)
- <b>view</b> data or only chosen fields of it
- <b>sort</b> the data by a chosen field

## SQL Schema
